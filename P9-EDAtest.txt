/*
1. `import pandas as pd`: This line imports the pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

2. `import numpy as np`: This line imports the numpy library and assigns it the alias `np`.

3. `import seaborn as sns`: This line imports the seaborn library and assigns it the alias `sns`.

4. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: This line imports the pyplot module from the matplotlib library and assigns it the alias `plt`.

5. `df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')`: This line reads the 'test.csv' file using the `read_csv` function from pandas and assigns the resulting DataFrame to the variable `df`.

6. `df`: This line displays the contents of the DataFrame `df`, showing the data from the 'test.csv' file.

7. `cols = df.columns`: This line assigns the column names of the DataFrame `df` to the variable `cols`.

8. `cols`: This line displays the column names of the DataFrame `df`.

9. `print(df.info())`: This line prints the concise summary of the DataFrame `df`, including information about the column names, data types, and non-null values.

10. `print(df.describe())`: This line prints the statistical summary of the DataFrame `df`, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values for each numerical column.

11. `print(df.isnull().sum())`: This line prints the sum of null values in each column of the DataFrame `df`, indicating how many missing values are present in each column.

12. `sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Age', hue='Survived', data=df)`: This line creates a boxplot using the `boxplot` function from seaborn. It shows the distribution of ages (`Age`) for different genders (`Sex`) and different survival outcomes (`Survived`). The `hue` parameter is used to differentiate the boxes based on the survival status.

13. `sns.boxplot(x='Sex', y='Age', data=df)`: This line creates a boxplot using the `boxplot` function from seaborn. It shows the distribution of ages (`Age`) for different genders (`Sex`). It does not consider the survival status.

Note: The meaning of the lines is provided based on their functionality, but without the actual data, it's not possible to provide specific interpretations or insights into the plots.
